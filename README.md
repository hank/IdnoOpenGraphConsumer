Idno OpenGraph Embed
===============

This plugin automatically transforms any inline http or https link into a
OpenGraph rendered version, similar to Twitter Summary Cards.  It uses the
[OpenGraph protocol](http://ogp.me/) and a small library found
[here](https://github.com/scottmac/opengraph) to do the data collection.

It leaves alone links and other referenced URLs by requiring whitespace to
surround the URL itself.
